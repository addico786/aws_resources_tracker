# 🛠️ AWS Resource Tracker (Automated)

This project is a simple shell script that automates the process of tracking AWS resources such as:

- 🪣 S3 Buckets  
- 🖥️ EC2 Instances  
- 🌀 Lambda Functions  
- 👤 IAM Users  

It’s designed to run at scheduled intervals using `cron`, and logs the output to a `.log` file for review.
